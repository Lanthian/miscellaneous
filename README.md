# miscellaneous
Miscellaneous one-off projects I've written for specific tasks. No guarantees of complete code - in most cases, programs are ran to specification then abandoned. 
I've created this repository to keep track of these haphazard programs, in turn hoping to avoid rewriting code.

[count_files.py](count_files.py) - Counts the number of lines in certain file types within the directory it is in. Ran with python; no input parameters.
